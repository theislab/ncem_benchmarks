# From grid searches to production models with ncem
The grid searches ran here depend on a conda environment named "ncem" with ncem and ncem_benchmarks installed.
The grid searches are run in SLURM, if you decide to also do this on a SLURM system, you need to update the SLURM parameters according to your system.
